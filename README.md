# rectools
Advanced package for recommender systems.

We allow the user to incorporate user and item covariate information, and offer other capabilities not seen in other packages.

Main functions included so far:

   * covNMF(), which adds a covariate capability to the nonnegative matrix factorization approach to recommender systems.
   * buildMatrix(), which builds a new matrix from a given data set to represent a user ratings matrix in which the users are the rows,       the item they are rating is the columns, and the values are the ratings.
   * Various utilities.
